I am a student in the UK with a passion for all things computers and Infosec. I am interested in physical security and social engineering. I don't enjoy webdev. But I do enjoy spending time writing not so good code and doing HackTheBox. I post occasionally on twitter about things that make me laugh. I also enjoy playing video games just for fun. All my socials are linked above if you want to contact me.
